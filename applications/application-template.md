## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Music as NFTs is only beginning to pop in society. Someone has to pioneer and see it done 
right. Meta verse sites like decentraland are constantly looking for art to display In galleries. 
I propose some various cover arts, videos and songs for the NFT Blockchain. 

I also want to make AI technology more accessible to people. A do it yourself Artificial 
Intelligence builder project, is another piece of work I would use the funding for.

If funded the funds will be used to pay for featuring artists and distribution of future projects, 
the above proposal all for the purpose of adding liquidity to Eon Prime token to help my fans who are invested.

- (one sentence summary tag line): this is a request to fund a new token on the bsc network called, Eon Prime (EONP).
- The token will be used to fund research by artists and crypto traders. 
- The token can be used as a cheaper alternative to other alt coins on platforms (with a tax fee of only 2%).

in a massive way. making a token now is our way of saying thank you to the thousands of people who have brought us this far.
